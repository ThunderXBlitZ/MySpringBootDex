# SpringBootDex

A modern glossary for Spring Boot / Spring annotations.

Daunted by the official [Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)/[Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) documentation? No doubt they are extensive and the best source of documentation, yet like many others, I found the learning curve still steep due to Spring/Spring Boot's rich history.

Hence the idea to create a (not literally) ELI5 guide/glossary, that serves as as a training guide for newbies, as well as a quick lookup for professionals. Feel free to make suggestions and contribute!

# Contribution Rules

1. Keep it simple! Keep the languange concise and non-technical where possible.
2. Add internal/external links where possible e.g. [@SpringBootApplication](https://thunderxblitz.github.io/MySpringBootDex/beginner/SpringBootApplication) links to [@Configuration](https://thunderxblitz.github.io/MySpringBootDex/beginner/Configuration). Internal links enable the tooltip feature (which I hope people find handy)
3. References to external guides are encouraged, with a short write up, but do give credit where its due.
